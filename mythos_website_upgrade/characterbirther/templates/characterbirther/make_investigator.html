  <p>Remember you can always <a href="http://www.mythos-acts.ca/#contact">contact</a> me by email directly or to set up a quick phone call/IRL session to go over the process of character creation. I might be able to save you time by pointing you to relevant skills given a verbal description of your character concept. The goal of this game is to explore your <a href="https://youtu.be/YfY1lfFu8j8?t=45s">character</a> (known in-game as an Investigator) and the <a href="https://youtu.be/_ccxVZXRZS8?t=10s">environment</a> in a space where you have the freedom to be as unashamedly cautious or reckless as you can conceive. We will build this story together.</p>
